# 🧬 Soft Computing Java Library 

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of a multi-phase **Soft Computing Library** built in **Java**.  
The goal of the library is to provide modular and reusable implementations of major **soft computing techniques**, including:
1. Genetic Algorithms (GA) – Phase 1
2. Fuzzy Logic – Phase 2
3. Neural Networks – Phase 3

Each phase adds one soft computing component and demonstrates it through a **real-world case study**.

This document covers **Phase 1: Genetic Algorithm (GA)**.

## ⚙️ Phase 1: Genetic Algorithm (GA)

### 🎯 Objective
In this phase, we implemented a **Genetic Algorithm** capable of solving optimization problems.  
The GA is designed to be **generic**, **configurable**, and **extensible**, supporting different chromosome types and genetic operators.

### 🧩 Features Implemented
- **Chromosome types**:
    - Binary Chromosome
    - Integer Chromosome
    - Floating-Point Chromosome
- **Selection Methods** (at least two):

- **Crossover Methods** (at least three):

- **Mutation Methods** (for each chromosome type):

- **Replacement Strategies** (three implemented):

- **Hyperparameter Configuration**:
    - Population size
    - Number of generations
    - Crossover rate
    - Mutation rate
    - Selection and crossover type
